## Key Concepts to Learn

### Beginner Level
- Basic syntax and program structure
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control structures (if-else, switch, loops)
- Functions and basic I/O operations
- Arrays and strings

### Intermediate Level
- Pointers and memory management
- Structures and unions
- File I/O operations
